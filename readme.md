## Methodology: Predicting Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) Values Using Machine Learning

### Introduction

This study presents a novel approach to predict thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) values at arbitrary temperatures, including those not directly measured in laboratory experiments. Our methodology combines principles from materials science with advanced statistical learning techniques to create a reliable predictive model with quantified uncertainty.

### Data Collection and Preparation

The experimental data consisted of paired temperature and TGA measurements collected under controlled laboratory conditions. These measurements represent the thermal decomposition behavior of the material under study. Prior to analysis, the data was:

1. Examined for outliers and measurement errors
2. Split into training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets
3. Normalized using standardization techniques to ensure all values fall within comparable ranges, which improves the learning process

### Predictive Modeling Approach

#### Neural Network Architecture

We implemented a specialized form of artificial neural network - a mathematical model inspired by biological neural systems that can learn complex patterns from data. Our specific implementation includes:

- A three-layer feedforward neural network with nonlinear activation functions
- Input layer: Temperature values
- Hidden layers: Mathematical transformations that capture complex relationships
- Output layer: Predicted TGA values
- Regularization techniques to prevent overfitting to the training data

#### Monte Carlo Dropout for Uncertainty Quantification

A critical scientific requirement is understanding the uncertainty in predictions. We employed Monte Carlo Dropout, a Bayesian approximation technique that:

1. Introduces controlled randomness during both training and prediction phases
2. Generates multiple predictions for each temperature input
3. Calculates statistical measures (mean and standard deviation) from these predictions
4. Constructs confidence intervals at user-specified confidence levels (e.g., 95%)

This approach allows us to report not just a single predicted value, but a range within which the true value is likely to fall with a specified probability.

### Model Training Process

The model was trained using the following systematic approach:

1. **Objective Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) minimization between predicted and actual TGA values
2. **Optimization Algorithm**: Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), which efficiently navigates the complex mathematical landscape to find optimal model parameters
3. **Early Stopping**: Training was automatically terminated when performance on the validation set stopped improving, preventing overfitting
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Key model parameters (learning rate, network size, dropout rate) were systematically optimized to maximize predictive accuracy

### Validation and Performance Assessment

The model's performance was rigorously evaluated using:

1. **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Measures the average magnitude of prediction errors
2. **Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²)**: Quantifies the proportion of variance in TGA values explained by the model
3. **Residual Analysis**: Systematic examination of prediction errors to ensure no patterns were left uncaptured
4. **Confidence Interval Coverage**: Verification that the predicted confidence intervals contain the true values at the expected rate

### Practical Application

The trained model enables:

1. Prediction of TGA values at any temperature within the studied range
2. Quantification of prediction uncertainty through confidence intervals
3. Interpolation between experimental measurements, reducing the need for additional laboratory tests
4. Potential extrapolation to temperatures outside the measured range (with appropriate caution regarding increased uncertainty)

### Visualization and Interpretation

The results are presented through publication-quality visualizations that show:

1. Actual vs. predicted TGA values across the temperature range
2. Confidence intervals that visually represent prediction uncertainty
3. Residual analysis plots that validate model assumptions
4. Performance metrics that quantify prediction accuracy

These visualizations are designed to be interpretable by researchers without specialized knowledge of machine learning techniques.

### Conclusion

This methodology represents a rigorous scientific approach to predicting material properties, combining experimental data with advanced statistical techniques. The inclusion of uncertainty quantification through confidence intervals ensures that predictions are presented with appropriate scientific caution, acknowledging the limitations inherent in any predictive model.

The approach demonstrates how modern computational methods can complement traditional experimental techniques in materials science, potentially reducing the need for extensive laboratory testing while maintaining scientific rigor through careful validation and uncertainty quantification.
